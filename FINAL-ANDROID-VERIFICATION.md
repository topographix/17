# üéØ **RESTORED TO WORKING STATE**

## **What I Did**
I restored the GitHub Actions workflow to the EXACT simple version that was working before all the recent changes.

## **Removed All Complex Additions**
- ‚ùå Removed Node.js setup
- ‚ùå Removed Capacitor sync attempts  
- ‚ùå Removed complex file creation logic
- ‚ùå Removed duplicate workflows

## **Simple Working Workflow Restored**
```yaml
name: Build APK

jobs:
  build:
    steps:
    - Checkout code
    - Setup Java 17  
    - Setup Android SDK
    - Cache Gradle
    - Build APK (assembleDebug)
    - Upload APK artifact
```

## **Why This Will Work**
The original workflow was working because it didn't try to mess with Capacitor files. It just built what was already in the repository.

**The real issue**: We kept trying to "fix" something that wasn't broken in the first place.

## **Next Push Should Work**
Your next push to GitHub will use this simple, proven workflow that was working before we started overcomplicating it.

No more complex file generation, no more duplicate workflows, just the basic build process that worked.
