// Second message  
{"success":true,"response":"[AI Response]","remainingDiamonds":23}
```

## ISSUE 2: Back Button Not Working - ✅ FIXED IN CODE

### Fixed Both Back Button Types:

1. **In-App Back Button (Chat Header)**:
   ```java
   // Complete interface rebuild to home screen
   setContentView(null);
   createInteractiveInterface();
   ```

2. **System Back Button (Android)**:
   ```java
   if ("chat".equals(currentScreen)) {
       // Clear all chat state + rebuild home interface
       setContentView(null);
       createInteractiveInterface();
   }
   ```

### Status:
- **Navigation**: Safe return to home screen from chat
- **State Cleanup**: All chat variables cleared
- **Error Handling**: Complete interface recreation prevents crashes
