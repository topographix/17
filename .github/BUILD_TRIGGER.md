# APK Build Trigger

This file triggers the GitHub Actions workflow to build the APK.

## Status: READY TO BUILD

### Fixes Applied:
- Added duplicate file cleanup to GitHub workflow
- Verified single MainActivity.java file exists
- Confirmed proper Java class declaration
- Ready for production APK build

### Latest Update: August 26, 2025 - 11:31 AM

**FIXED:** Removed restrictive path filters from GitHub workflow. Actions now trigger on any push to main branch.

The workflow will now:
1. Clean any duplicate MainActivity files
2. Build the diagnostic APK
3. Upload the APK as an artifact

**Expected Result**: Working APK with embedded diagnostic interface.
