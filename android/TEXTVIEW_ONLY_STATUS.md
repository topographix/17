# TextView-Only APK Status

## COMPLETE WEBVIEW ELIMINATION APPROACH

### Strategy:
Since WebView keeps crashing, this version completely removes WebView and uses only TextView to test if the basic Android app structure works.

### Code Changes:
1. **Removed WebView entirely** - No webkit imports or WebView creation
2. **Pure TextView implementation** - Basic Android TextView with styling
3. **Minimal dependencies** - Only essential Android imports
4. **Zero web technology** - No HTML, CSS, or JavaScript

### Expected Behavior:
- Purple background (RedVelvet pink #E91E63)
- White text centered on screen
- Message: "RedVelvet Mobile - TextView Test"
- Should NOT crash on any Android device

### Diagnosis Purpose:
If this version still crashes, the issue is NOT with WebView but with:
- Android manifest configuration
- Build process issues
- Device compatibility problems
- Basic Android app structure

If this version works, we can gradually add WebView back with proper configuration.
