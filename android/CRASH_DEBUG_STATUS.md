# APK Crash Debug Status

## Changes Made:
1. **Added Internet Permissions** - INTERNET and ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permissions added to AndroidManifest.xml
2. **Ultra-Minimal HTML** - Removed all JavaScript to prevent script execution crashes
3. **Enhanced Error Handling** - Added try-catch blocks around HTML generation
4. **Simplified WebView Loading** - Minimal content to test basic WebView functionality

## Expected Behavior:
- APK should load without crashing
- Display simple RedVelvet interface with purple background
- Show "APK Loading Test" status message
- No interactive elements to prevent JavaScript crashes

## Debug Information:
- Build Date: January 7, 2025
- Version: Crash Debug 1.0
- HTML Length: ~400 characters (minimal)
- JavaScript: Disabled for stability

If this version still crashes, the issue is likely in Android configuration or WebView setup, not the HTML content.
