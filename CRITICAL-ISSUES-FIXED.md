# âœ… **GITHUB ACTIONS BUILD - FINAL FIX**

## **Root Cause Confirmed**
The GitHub Actions builds keep failing because the `cordova.variables.gradle` file doesn't exist in the GitHub repository (it's in .gitignore locally).

## **Solution Applied**
Added a step in the GitHub Actions workflow to create the missing file before the build starts:

```yaml
- name: Create missing Capacitor files for GitHub Actions
  run: |
    mkdir -p android/capacitor-cordova-android-plugins
    cat > android/capacitor-cordova-android-plugins/cordova.variables.gradle << 'EOF'
// DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE! IT IS GENERATED EACH TIME "capacitor update" IS RUN
ext {
  cdvMinSdkVersion = project.hasProperty('minSdkVersion') ? rootProject.ext.minSdkVersion : 23
  // Plugin gradle extensions can append to this to have code run at the end.
  cdvPluginPostBuildExtras = []
  cordovaConfig = [:]
}
EOF
```

## **Why This Will Work**
- Creates the exact file content that exists locally
- Runs before the Gradle build step
- Simple solution without complex Capacitor sync

The next push to GitHub should build successfully.
