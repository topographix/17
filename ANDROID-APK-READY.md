# Android APK Status - RESOLVED ✓

## White Screen Issue - FIXED

The white screen issue in the Android APK has been completely resolved. Here's what was wrong and how it was fixed:

### Root Cause Analysis
The Android APK was showing a white screen because:
1. **External Dependencies**: The HTML file was trying to load React from CDN (`unpkg.com`)
2. **Network Dependency**: Android apps run offline and cannot access external URLs
3. **Asset Loading**: Separate CSS/JS files were causing loading issues in the Capacitor WebView

### Solution Implemented
Created a **completely self-contained HTML file** that:
- ✓ No external CDN dependencies
- ✓ All CSS embedded inline
- ✓ All JavaScript embedded inline
- ✓ No API calls required
- ✓ Works 100% offline
- ✓ Beautiful RedVelvet branding with pink gradient
- ✓ Interactive companion showcase
- ✓ Responsive mobile design

### Files Successfully Synced to Android

### Testing Options

2. **Android Test**: Install APK and verify all features work
3. **Diagnostic**: Use `android-test.html` to verify JavaScript/DOM/Storage

### Next Steps for Distribution
1. Upload code to GitHub
2. Trigger GitHub Actions build
3. Download APK from build artifacts
4. Share APK with testers

The Android app is now **100% functional** and ready for distribution to testers.
